"""Tool to generate JSON files that define clock animation.

This module contains a script that will generate JSON files. The files are
intendend to be used as resource model data for the clock in Minecraft. The
files will be added to an 'output' folder added in the same directory as this
module.

For modularity, this module imports from a user made module to define frames and
times to encode.

Todo:
    * Determine user made module dependencies
    * Implement JSON file attributes
    * Save files to output folder
