# Clock-JSON-Generator
As of Minecraft Java Edition 1.12, resources have changed for items that animate based on game events, such as the clock and compass. Before the update, frames for these items were stored in a sprite sheet, and the game could support different length sprite sheets in custom resources, allowing variants of frame amounts. Following the update, frames are stored as separate image files, and the logic for event-driven animation is defined in JSON model files. While this adds options to redesign the animation in custom resources, the process of generating the model files manually can get confusing and tedious. This repository provides a tool in Python code to automate the model file generation for the clock item specifically.
